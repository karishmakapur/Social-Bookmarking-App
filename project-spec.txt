Architecture
- MVC
	- Model-View-Controller
	- Very popular for Web applications
	- View <-> controller <-> model
	- model holds business logic. 2 layers - service and daos layer.
		- dao communicates with database. (Data Access Objects).
		- service layer is the real business logic.
	- view is a presentation. JSP will represent view.
	- controller has the servlets. It holds the Java programs.
	- benefit is the seperation of business logic from presentation layer.
